- **lib/**: Contains the main codebase.
  - **main.dart**: Entry point of the app.
  - **controllers/**: Contains controller-related files (C in MVC).
  - **models/**: Contains data models (M in MVC).

## MVC Architecture

This app follows the MVC architecture to separate the concerns of the application:

- **Model**: Represents the data structure. Manages the data and business logic.
- **View**: Displays the data and sends user actions to the controller.
- **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between Model and View. It listens to the View, processes user inputs, and updates the Model.
